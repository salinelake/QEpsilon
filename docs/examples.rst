Example 1: Learning the dynamics of a CaF molecular qubit in optical tweezer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to use QEpsilon to learn the dynamics of a CaF molecular qubit in optical tweezers.
The data is from experiments as reported in Holland et al., Science 382, 1143â€“1147 (2023).
